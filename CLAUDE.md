Initial Analysis and Planning First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
Todo List Structure The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
Plan Verification Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
Task Execution Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
Communication Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made.
Simplicity Principle Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
Process Documentation Every time you perform actions related to the project, write a log of your actions to docs/activity.md and read that file whenever you find it necessary to assist you.
Review Process Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
